To start the entire quiz as a whole, you want to open the 

    classpect_quiz_python 

folder, and run

    classpect_quiz.py

file. If it doesn't work because you don't have python,
then get python. If it doesn't work for some other reason,
email me (cesiumtea@gmail.com) or find me on tumblr
(roubivia) to let me know about it.
