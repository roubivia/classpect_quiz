Rage: Subjugation and domination of will; narrowed perceptions; limiting options; determination and force of will

A Witch of Rage is someone who alters the anger and fear of others, and narrows perceptions. A Witch's abilities are based on changing the world around them, and a Witch of Rage does this by dominating the will of others, and narrowing options to find the best solution to a problem. A fully-realized Witch of Rage is a master of directly changing anger itself in order to achieve their goals.

Rage is an aspect based in limitation of choice, but also in the narrowed perceptions that lead to this limitation, and the subjugation of will necessary to achieve it; a Witch of Rage will bring about changes in not only limitation, but also use negative emotions to force others to their goal. They will tend to view their changes through the lens of restriction and domination, and of elimination of the bad rather than the proliferation of the good.

Witches are not hesitant to bring about direct and immediate change to take control of a situation. Witches of Rage, therefore, are willing to alter Rage, the aspect of domination and limitation, to complete their work.
